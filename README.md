# lab1
For this lab, I first started with the part 2 individual part. I didn't get stuck in particular in this portion of the lab, but had to refer to the following links on the hcard microformat: https://microformats.org/wiki/hcard, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats, https://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples-in-wild. For the personal resume, I made my profile picture a circle, and used this cropping tool to achieve that: https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/.

For part 1, my group and I met everyday during the week before submission. We first created a very basic wireframe in Figma just so everyone can refer to the same guide for layout of the portfolio page. The hardest part of this section of the lab was getting every component together in one styles.css file - we had to make sure there was no overlap in naming conventions, by going through everyone's css to make sure we are not overwriting styles in someone else's resume. After linking everyone's resumes, we moved on to the past projects page. Here, we each took a screenshot of what we did in Intro. The hardest part here was trying to get the 4 project boxes spaced correctly, and not shifted to one way. For portfolio inspiration, I looked at these links: https://in.pinterest.com/pin/63683782214856789/ (color scheme), https://dribbble.com/tags/portfolio_landing_page, https://bootstrapmade.com/bootstrap-landing-page-templates/, https://css-tricks.com/creating-meet-team-page-wordpress/. After coding together, we put the code through validators and added comments.
